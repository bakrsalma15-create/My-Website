                <p>  I have always been fascinated by the visual arts and how we can tell stories through images and videos.</p>
                <br>

                <p>Where I’ve honed my Content creation and Reel creation skills over the past 2 years, I have filmmaking skills from my collage years as well.</p>
                <br>

                <p>So far I’ve had the privilege of working on diverse projects that range from Short Films to Social Media Reels, and am always looking for the next project to work on.</p>
