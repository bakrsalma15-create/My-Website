                I’m Salma Bakr,
 Visual Content Creator and Artist. 
 <br>
 <br>
 I like to translate stories, thoughts, and ideas into something visual to see.
                <br>
                <br>
                I have always been fascinated by the visual arts and how we can tell stories through images and videos.
                <br>

Where I’ve honed my Content creation and Reel creation skills over the past 2 years, I have filmmaking skills from my collage years as well.
<br>
<br>

So far I’ve had the privilege of working on diverse projects that range from Short Films to Social Media Reels, and am always looking for the next project to work on</a>.
